Create your own maze and find the way out of them!

Its so simple, you can create paths by clicking the cells or just press the button "deafault maze" to create a deafult maze.

When the paths are done you can have fun finding the shortest way out in the maze.

Also you can find the safest way out of the maze using either djikstra or kruskal algorithm!
